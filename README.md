# A little bit about TomatOS:
## Paths.

Paths in TomatOS Linux are not your ususal Paths.
For example, this: `$>#>desktop` is the way to acces the desktop. But what does that mean?
`$` is the "master" folder. It contains the whole system.
`$>#` indicates that the "#" (core) folder is INSIDE $.
`$>#>desktop` Well, indicates that the desktop folder is inside the core folder (#), which is inside of the master folder ($).
So, basically, the `>` in TomatOS is the `/` of every other distro/OS.

## Extensions.

Now let's talk about the file extensions in TomatOS. It obviously supports your average daily-use extensions (.txt, .jpg, .png, .exe, blah blah blah). But it also supports many *programming extensions* ***by default***. No more default icons when making a .c file or a .js file. 
Nope. We don't like that here at TomatOS.

Supported extenions:
- .c
- .cs
- .cpp
- .rs
- .py
- .js
- .html
- .css
- .java
- .tos (TomatOS's own extension, used for system stuff).
